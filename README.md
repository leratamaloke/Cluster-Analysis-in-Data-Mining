Programming Assignment1: Implementing Clustering Validation Measures

Instructions
In this assignment, you will be implementing two clustering validation measures: Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) and Jaccard similarity.  

You will be given one ground-truth clustering (partition) results and five clustering test cases.  You need to evaluate the clustering test cases with regard to the ground-truth by NMI and Jaccard measures and submit your measures.  You will be graded based on whether your measures are correct.  

The ground-truth clustering (partition) results are stored in file "partitions.txt"; the five clustering result test cases are stored in file "clustering_1.txt", ..., "clustering_5.txt".  

All files including partitions.txt, clustering_1.txt, ..., can be downloaded from the data.zip file attached below.

data.zip
Each clustering result (both ground-truth and test cases) is represented by a file.  Each line in a file consists of two integers, separated by a space.  The first integer represents the id of a data item, and the second integer represents the id of the cluster which this item belongs to.  

You need to submit a file titled "scores.txt" consisting of 5 lines.  Each line contains two float numbers separated by a space.  The first number of the i-th line represents the NMI measure you calculated for the i-th test case i (i.e. "clustering_i.txt") with regard to the ground-truth given in "partitions.txt", and the second number of the i-th line represents the Jaccard measure you calculated for the i-th test case. 

As an example, a valid submission may look like:

12345
0.1000000 0.2000000
0.3000000 0.4000000
0.5000000 0.6000000
0.7000000 0.8000000
0.9000000 1.0000000
You will be graded based on whether your file format is correct and onhow many measures you submitted are correct.
